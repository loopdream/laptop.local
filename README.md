# laptop.local

My personal laptop.local file for use with [ThoughtBot's Laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)

It will set up a new mac by installing all the core applications and software I need.

1. Install Xcode on your mac
2. Download the .laptop.local file to your root home directory `~/.laptop.local`
